# Particles

This is a fun toy you can play with in your browser (including your phone's/tablet's browser). It's hosted at [particles.johncs.com](https://particles.johncs.com), check it out!

## Controls

The important controls are (hopefully) discoverable but here's a list of everything you can do:

* `[click]` inverts the mass of the mouse's gravity well
* `[mouse move]` moves the mouse's gravity well to the mouse
* `[spacebar]` resets all the particles
* `[touch/drag]` creates a gravity well at touch point
* `[multi-touch/drag]` creates a gravity well at each touch point

## History

I made this in C back in high school ([original source](https://www.github.com/itsjohncs/particles)) but remade it in Javascript at some point while in college.
