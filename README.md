This is a JS port of an [old particle engine](https://www.github.com/itsjohncs/particles) I made in high school. It doesn't really serve any purpose, but hopefully it's fun to play with!

Here are all the different actions that are supported:

* `[click]` inverts the mass of the mouse's gravity well
* `[mouse move]` moves the mouse's gravity well to the mouse
* `[spacebar]` resets all the particles
* `[touch/drag]` creates a gravity well at touch point
* `[multi-touch/drag]` creates a gravity well at each touch point
